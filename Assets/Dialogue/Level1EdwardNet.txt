Hey you! The rag!
Come over here and let me down.
...
What? How did I get stuck up here?
Don't ask stupid questions!
I was just taking a stroll and got my leg caught in this terribly placed trap!
Now get to helping me down!

Get back you beast!
I don't need your riffraff near me!

Couldn't you have let me down gentler?
I know rags aren't used to being delicate, but I'm important cargo.
What? You don't know what that thing was?
Where have you been?
All the tailors have reformed, and these monsters have been ehre for weeks!

Hmm I can't untie this.
